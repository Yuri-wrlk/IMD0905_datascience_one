You may also realize that we rarely rewrite the same code twice; instead, we use a method that allows us to reuse code, **functions** such as **print()**, **type()**, **open()**, etc. Now, we formally define functions.\n","\n","As we have seen before, a function is a packaged body of code that we can reuse by **calling** with the relevant parameters. The parameters that a function takes are called the **inputs** of the function, and the result that it returns is called the **output**. For example, we called the **open()** function with two inputs (the strings **\"movie_metadata.csv\"** and **\"r\"**), and received the output which is a **wrapper** for the file **movie_metadata.csv.** All functions follow the same road map as **open()**: They take in **input(s)**, execute the code that they surround, and return an **output**.\n","\n","Because functions are **reusable**, we can package all the parsing we just did into one function. Then, we can call the function whenever we need to parse a file instead of having to rewrite the necessary code every time. We have been making extensive use of functions, so this should not be unfamiliar. If we had a **parser()** function, the code for the last instructions would be as concise as this:\n","\n",">```python\n",">>> movie_data = parser(movie_metadata)\n",">>> print(movie_data[0:5])\n","[['movie_title', 'director_name', 'color', 'duration', 'actor_1_name', 'language', 'country', 'title_year'], ['Avatar', 'James Cameron', 'Color', '178', 'CCH Pounder', 'English', 'USA', '2009'], [\"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\", 'Gore Verbinski', 'Color', '169', 'Johnny Depp', 'English', 'USA', '2007'], ['Spectre', 'Sam Mendes', 'Color', '148', 'Christoph Waltz', 'English', 'UK', '2015'], ['The Dark Knight Rises', 'Christopher Nolan', 'Color', '164', 'Tom Hardy', 'English', 'USA', '2012']]\n","```\n","\n","Other than reusability, there are **3 main advantages of using functions**:\n","\n","- They allow us to use other people's code without the necessity to have a deep understanding of how it was written (e.g., we use the **print()** function without reading the code inside it). We call this information hiding.\n","\n","- They **break down complex logic** into smaller components or modules. Instead of writing very lengthy and complicated code, we can progress function by function. For example, if we were writing a larger piece of code, **parser()** as a function would be easier to manage rather than the code that executes the same behavior. This would make testing easier as well. We refer to this as **modularity**, which is especially important when working on teams. **Modularity makes it easier for someone else to read, understand, use, and build upon our code.**\n","- They streamline our code and make it easier **to maintain**. Programmers reuse the same functions in multiple situations across a project. This means that they generalize the function as much as possible to maximize its usefulness. we call this **process abstraction**, which is an important part of reducing our code's complexity, especially for larger projects.\n","\n","\n","Knowing the usefulness of functions, let's see how we can write our own functions.\n","\n","\n","Up until now, we used **built-in** functions: **functions that Python has defined for us**. However, our toolbox is not limited to this; we can write our own functions. The syntax for defining a function consists of 5 parts:\n","\n","- **def keyword** - For Python to interpret the following code as a function\n","- **Name** - To refer to when we need to call the function later\n","- **Arguments** - Input value(s) that the function takes in\n","- **Body** - The code that the function executes\n","- **Return value** - The value that the function returns to the user when the function terminates\n","\n","Let us examine the syntax further, using an example function that returns the first element of a list:\n","\n",">```python\n","def first_elt(input_lst):\n","    first = input_lst[0]\n","    return first\n","```\n","\n","We start the function definition with the keyword **def**. We give the function a name that explains its use, in this case: **first_elt()**. Then, we name the single argument that the function takes. Here, we name the argument **input_lst**, suggesting to the user that the function must take in a list as input. In the next line, we define the body of the function, which consists of only one line in our case. This is the actual code that will be executed when the function is called. Finally, we use the keyword **\"return\"** to signify the end of the function, and type the variable that we want returned to the user, in this case, **first**.\n","\n","Here, we should take note of the **indentation** of the function. Realize that after the colon, we indent the remainder of the function by one **tab**, which is the equivalent of **4 space bar strokes**. This is to clarify to Python what part of the code belongs to the function. Therefore, indentation makes functional differences in Python's interpretation of the code. You may notice that if you format the first line of the function correctly, so that Python recognizes that the next line will be the beginning of the function body, it indents the next line by 1 tab automatically. To make this behavior clear, you can see the diagram below and try for yourself. Notice that we do not need to press tab or space bar; Python automatically puts the indentation when we press enter.\n","\n","<img width=\"400\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1AV7PYW5SrQUPClQwskn_81dqemm9r8aN\">\n","\n","One other thing to note is that **first** and **input_lst** are temporary variables, which means that they are only accessible inside the function. If you attempt to use first somewhere else in the code outside the function, you will get an error saying that first is undefined. For example, observe the example below:\n","\n","\n","<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=19QaXF1ldAkF1rGIF2zzMZnAz40V89aql\">\n","\n","\n","This error occurs because first does not have a defined value outside of the **first_elt()** function. Then, in order to access the return value of this function, we set it equal to a variable, so the variable gets the function's return value.

We can take advantage of this to add an **if statement** that returns a value if a certain criteria is met, and another value otherwise. For example, let's take a look at a function that checks whether or not the first element of a list is \"blah\":\n","\n",">```python\n","def is_blah(input_lst):\n","    if input_lst[0] == \"blah\":\n","        return True\n","    else:\n","        return False\n","```\n","\n","Here, the indentation gives us the necessary intuition to decipher how the function works. If the list's first element is the string \"blah\", then the first return will execute, and the function will end there. However, if the first element is not \"blah\", then the function will continue without executing **return True**, because it doesn't enter that path.

As you become more proficient in programming, however, you'll learn to identify potential runtime errors beforehand and prevent them from occurring. Python and most other programming languages include tools like error handling and automated tests that help you manage and reduce runtime errors. As your code becomes more complex, you'll learn how to incorporate errors into the functions you write to so that they fail gracefully, and prevent certain negative behavior from occurring.\n","\n","[The documentation for Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndentationError) includes a full list of possible errors.
