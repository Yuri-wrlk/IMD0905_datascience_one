All field-values are taken from this date.\n","- **name** - Name of the car.\n","- **seller** - Whether the seller is private or a dealer\n","- **offerType** - The type of listing\n","- **price** - The price on the ad to sell the car.\n","- **abtest** - Whether the listing is included in an A/B test.\n","- **vehicleType** - The vehicle Type.\n","- **yearOfRegistration** - The year in which which year the car was first registered.\n","- **gearbox** - The transmission type.\n","- **powerPS** - The power of the car in PS.\n","- **model** - The car model name.\n","- **kilometer** - How many kilometers the car has driven.\n","- **monthOfRegistration** - The month in which which year the car was first registered.\n","- **fuelType** - What type of fuel the car uses.\n","- **brand** - The brand of the car.\n","- **notRepairedDamage** - If the car has a damage which is not yet repaired.\n","- **dateCreated** - The date on which the eBay listing was created.\n","- **nrOfPictures** - The number of pictures in the ad.\n","- **postalCode** - The postal code for the location of the vehicle.\n","- **lastSeenOnline** - When the crawler saw this ad last online.\n","\n","The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings.

We also converted the **price** and **odometer** columns to numeric types and renamed **odometer** to **odometer_km**.\n","\n","Let's continue exploring the data, specifically looking for data that doesn't look right. We'll start by analyzing the **odometer_km** and **price** columns. Here's the steps we'll take:\n","\n","- Analyze the columns using minimum and maximum values and look for any values that look unrealistically high or low (outliers) that we might want to remove.\n","- We'll use:\n","  - **Series.unique().shape** to see how many unique values\n","  - **Series.describe()** to view min/max/median/mean etc\n","  - **Series.value_counts()**, with some variations:\n","    - chained to **.head()** if there are lots of values.\n","    - Because **Series.value_counts()** returns a series, we can use **Series.sort_index()** with **ascending=True** or **False** to view the highest and lowest values with their counts (can also chain to head() here).\n","    - When removing outliers, we can do df[(df[\"col\"] > x ) & (df[\"col\"] < y )], but it's more readable to use df[df[\"col\"].[between(x,y)](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.22/generated/pandas.Series.between.html)]\n","    \n","\n","**Exercise**\n","\n","<img width=\"100\"

the data\n","  - If you find there are outliers, remove them and write a markdown paragraph explaining your decision.\n","  - After you have removed the outliers, make some observations about the remaining values, with examples of how we can use that to extract **YYYY**, **YYYY-MM** or **YYYY-MM-DD** from those
