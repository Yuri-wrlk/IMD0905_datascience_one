For those unfamiliar with Ed Sheeran, Ed Sheeran is an english singer, songwriter and producer. [Ed Sheeran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sheeran) has produced grammy award winning singles [Thinking Out Loud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp-EO5I60KA), [Shape of You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGwWNGJdvx8) and many more.\n","\n","In this section, we'll be creating a mad libs of Ed Sheeran's song [The A Team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAWcs5H-qgQ). [Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) is a game where we take a story and remove certain words:\n","\n","```\n","My mind was [VERB]-ing. After spending a day learning about [TOPIC], I couldn't [VERB] for another minute.\n","\n","I stepped outside my [NOUN], only to see a(n) [NOUN] outside my window. As the [NOUN] struck the [NOUN],\n","\n","a [NOUN] filled my [NOUN]. I ran out of the [NOUN] and [VERB]-ed. A newfound sense of [NOUN] arose.\n","```\n","\n","After removing the words, we replace these words with our own words. Often times, the ensuing story is comical and non-sensical:\n","\n","```\n","My mind was [swimming]-ing. After spending a day learning about [dirt], I couldn't [eat] for another minute.\n","\n","I stepped outside my [house], only to see a(n) [polar bear] outside my window. As the [polar bar] struck the [horse],\n","\n","a [snowman] filled my [house]. I ran out of the [house] and [screamed]-ed. A newfound sense of [peace] arose.\n","```\n","\n","In this section, we'll taking Ed Sheeran's lyrics and transforming his lyrics into a mad libs game. We'll write a program that:\n","\n","- Detects the nouns, verbs and adjectives in his lyrics.\n","\n","- Replaces these nouns, verbs and adjectives with placeholders.\n","\n","- Then, we'll replace these placeholders with our own words.\n","\n","If you'd like to see the lyrics to this song, click [here](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/edsheeran/theateam.html). Here's a sample of the first few lines of the song:\n","\n","```\n","White lips, pale face\n","\n","Breathing in snowflakes\n","\n","Burnt lungs, sour taste\n","\n","........\n","```\n","\n","Through the process of creating this mad libs program, you'll learn how to:\n","\n","- Plan out your program using pseudo-code\n","\n","- Split a string into multiple strings\n","\n","- Change string letters to upper and lower case\n","\n","- Concatenate two strings into one\n","\n","- Replace specific portions of a string\n","\n","- Format a string based on our input.\n","\n","Let's get started!\n","\n","**Exercise**\n","\n","<img width=\"100\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1E8tR7B9YYUXsU_rddJAyq0FrM0MSelxZ\">\n","\n","\n","1.

However, for more complex programs (like creating the mad libs program), we'll need to write **pseudo code**. Pseudo-code helps us organize our thoughts and outlines what our program is going to do before we write any code. The more concepts/ideas we put into our short-term memory, the more we need to manage.\n","\n","Let's examine these three steps through the lens of finding the length of a list:\n","\n","\n","<img width=\"400\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1X3VZ2ls9raHBQJecjxe-WQhlkcf1StrS\">\n","\n","\n","Notice, for step two, we wrote out the logic for finding the length, without writing it in code. There is no one, correct way of writing pseudo-code. The purpose of pseuod-code is to assist you in writing out your logic so there's no singular correct answer. You can write your pseudocode on a notepad, in a word document, as comments etc. Experiment to see which style you prefer.\n","\n","While writing pseudo-code, it's useful to make drawings of what your program does.

However, as a budding Data Analyst or Data Scientist, we should always maintain a healthy degree of skepticism towards our initial results. We should always ask additional questions to either validate, invalidate or better understand our results. Some additional questions we might ask:\n","\n","- What factors could be influencing our results?\n","- Within these factors, which have the highest degree of influence on our results?\n","- How could our initial approach bias our results?\n","\n","Whenever we're performing an analysis, a common influence on our results is **time**. Time often guides our own behavior. We tend to shop more during the month of December compared to August. During winter time, we likely use the heater more. We're also more likely to use the internet during the daytime for work rather than 3am.\n","\n","A dataset often reflects changes with respect to time. For example, we might conclude that Ed Sheeran was the dominant artist of 2017. However, our results could be heavily influenced by spikes in one or two months:\n","\n","<img width=\"500\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1qC7CqtIMY5cDfXrQFhpoa1MCwxnuNU-t\">\n","\n","\n","A huge spike in two months, could drastically skew our conclusion. There's a possibility that Spotify users listen to Ed Sheeran more on certain months of the year than others. Perhaps, Ed Sheeran isn't the most popular artist in January to March, but is extremely popular during the summer months. We don't know.\n","\n","To better understand our results with respect to time, we'll be answering the following question in this mission:\n","\n","- **Who is the dominant artist for each month of the year?**\n","\n","We'll be working with a subset of the [Spotify WorldWide Daily Song Ranking dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/edumucelli/spotifys-worldwide-daily-song-ranking).

To answer our initial question, we'll need to extract the month out of our string. One way of doing this, would be to split this string into a list, extract the month string and convert the month to an int:\n","\n","```python\n","date = \"2017-01-01\"\n","date = date.split(\"-\")\n","date = [int(d) for d in date]\n","month = date[-1]\n","```\n","\n","Rather than extract the month manually, we can use the datetime module. The [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times. We'll learn about classes in the next mission. For now, think of classes as a bundle of methods and objects used for a specific purpose.\n","\n","The datetime module contains the following classes:\n","\n","- **time** - Represents time of day. To import:\n","\n","```python\n","from datetime import time\n","```\n","\n","- **date** - Represents a date in an idealized calendar. To import:\n","\n","```python\n","from datetime import date\n","```\n","\n","- **datetime** - Represents month, day, dayofweek, year etc. Combines both **time** class and **date** class. To import:\n","\n","```python\n","from datetime import datetime\n","```\n","\n","- **timedelta** - Represents duration of time, difference between two dates. To import:\n","\n","```python\n","from datetime import timedelta\n","```\n","\n","Since the **datetime** class encapsulates both **time** and **date**, we'll be using the **datetime** class in this lesson. The methods of the **datetime** class and **time**, **date** classes are generally very similar.\n","\n","Returning back to our over-arching questions, **Who is the dominant artist for each month of the year?** , we could use the **datetime** class to extract the **month** out from our dates. But before we extract the month from our dates, we'll need to understand how to use a datetime object. A **datetime** object represents a single point in time. Here's the default formatting for a datetime object:\n","\n","```python\n","datetime(YEAR, MONTH, DAYS, HOUR, MINUTE)\n","```\n","\n","Replacing **YEAR**,**MONTH** and **DAYS** with values:\n","\n","```python\n","datetime(2017, 1, 13, 5, 43)\n","```\n","\n","This would translate to 5:43AM on January 13th, 2017. If we were to print our object, the interpreter would return:\n","\n","```python\n","datetime.datetime(2017, 1, 13, 5, 43)\n","```\n","\n","If we wanted to create an object that took place in the afternoon, let's say 5:43 PM, we'd have to write 17 as the hour.
